                <p>This movie is one of my favorite Superhero movies because it is<br>
                    grounded in the dark reality and the philosophy of the order and justice.<br>
                    <br>
                    This movie is about the Batman fighting the menacing Joker from destroying <br>
                    his city, Gotham. The Joker will do everything he can to destroy everything <br>
                    that Batman holds dear and Batman must save Gotham and its citizens. <br>
                    <br>
                    This movie is the best superhero movie that DC can offer in lifetime.

                <p>
                    Tazza is a Korean gambling film where the main character, Goni, <br>
                    trains to become one of the best swindler using Korea's famous card game, <br>
                    Hwatu.<br>
                    <br>
                    I consider this movie one of the best movie that Korea has to offer <br>
                    without being too graphic or too grainy. This movie is realistic, and <br>
                    at the same time, keeps entertaining audiences with poetic storyline.

                <p>
                    Kimi No Na Wa is a Japanese Animation film that revolves around the <br>
                    two high schoolers, Mitsuha and Taki. They soon learn that they switched <br>
                    their bodies and begins to learn about each other despite being in two <br>
                    different regions. <br>
                    <br>
                    I like this movie because it keeps the romance, mystery, and action at <br>
                    entertaining pace. The ending that this movie provides is satisfying <br>
                    comedy and the main characters each serve their purposes without <br>
                    being too dull.
